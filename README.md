# Project Statement:

For our project, we plan to analyze NFL players and their success in the NFL measured in fantasy football statistics. This will include looking at the likelihood for a player to be successful based on college, position, and prior success. We will also look across games within a season and by team.

Questions to answer:

1. What college has highest fantasy point output since 2000?
        
        Visualizations: 
        
            -All schools, x_axis = count of players, y_axis = all years total fantasy points (scatter plot)
            
            -Top 20 schools and percentage of total points from position (stacked bar)
            
2. What position has the highest points?

        Visualizations:
            
            -Simple Comparison of total points by position (Pie or Bar)
            
            -Position by Year Total (Histogram)?
            
3. What trends are present for players from the top colleges for producing fantasy players and can a new player in the league have their production predicted based on their college?

        Visualizations:
        
            -Prediction analysis for 2017 season based on 2000-2016 for fantasy production based on players entering from top 20 college.
            
            -Prediction analysis for 2017 season based on 2000-2016 for fantasy production based on position entering into league.
