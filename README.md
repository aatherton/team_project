# Project Statement:

For our project, we plan to analyze NFL players and their success in the NFL measured in fantasy football statistics. This will include looking at the likelihood for a player to be successful based on college, position, and prior success. We will also look across games within a season and by team.

Questions to answer:

1.	What college has highest fantasy point output since 2000?
2.	What position has the highest points?
3.	What trends are present for players by position or team across a season?
