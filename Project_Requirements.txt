Technical Requirements:
[x] Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)
[x] Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process
[x] Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis
[x] Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
[x] Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation
[x] Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
[x] Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.

Presentation Requirements:
[x] Be at least 8-10 min. long
[x] Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.
[x] Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them
[x] Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
[x] Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
[x] Describe the analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
[x] Summarize your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data)
[ ] Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean".
[ ] Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.
